## Demo Script (10 minutes total)

### Opening Hook (1 minute)
> "Imagine you're a pastor in rural Oklahoma. Your church has 150 members, but your internet can barely handle email. Sunday morning, you want to stream your service to members who can't attend - elderly, sick, or traveling. Traditional solutions cost $100+ per month and require reliable internet. What if I told you there's a way to stream to 50+ people with zero monthly costs and no internet required?"

### Problem Statement (2 minutes)
**Show slide: Market Pain Points**
- "300,000 churches in the US face this exact problem"
- "78% want to stream services post-COVID"
- "Rural and international churches are underserved"
- "Current solutions: expensive, complex, internet-dependent"

### Solution Demo (5 minutes)

#### Step 1: Broadcaster Setup (1 minute)
1. **Launch broadcaster app**
   ```
   "This is our broadcaster application. Notice the clean, simple interface."
   ```
2. **Show status: "Ready to broadcast"**
   ```
   "No complex configuration needed. Just click start."
   ```
3. **Click "Start Broadcasting"**
   ```
   "The app automatically creates a P2P network and starts advertising the stream."
   ```

#### Step 2: Viewer Connection (2 minutes)
1. **Launch viewer app on second laptop**
   ```
   "This is what congregation members see on their phones or tablets."
   ```
2. **Show automatic discovery**
   ```
   "Notice it automatically found our broadcast - no IP addresses, no passwords."
   ```
3. **Click "Connect to Stream"**
   ```
   "One click to join. The app connects directly to the broadcaster via P2P."
   ```
4. **Show simulated video stream**
   ```
   "In production, this would show live video. The stream is happening entirely on our local network."
   ```

#### Step 3: Network Demonstration (1 minute)
1. **Disconnect internet on both devices**
   ```
   "Watch this - I'm disconnecting from the internet entirely."
   ```
2. **Show stream continues**
   ```
   "The stream continues perfectly. No internet required."
   ```
3. **Show multiple viewers (if available)**
   ```
   "Each additional viewer connects directly to the P2P network."
   ```

#### Step 4: Technical Highlights (1 minute)
1. **Show resource usage**
   ```
   "Look at the CPU and memory usage - minimal resources required."
   ```
2. **Explain scalability**
   ```
   "This same setup handles 50+ viewers on a $35 Raspberry Pi."
   ```

### Business Model (2 minutes)
**Show slide: Revenue Streams**
- "Hardware kits: $299 one-time purchase"
- "Software tiers: Free basic, $29/month pro"
- "Cloud services: Analytics, recording, multi-site"
- "Total addressable market: $300M annually"

**Show slide: Financial Projections**
- "Year 1: $150K revenue (proof of concept)"
- "Year 3: $2.5M revenue (market penetration)"
- "Year 5: $12.5M revenue (scale)"

### Closing (1 minute)
> "We're not just building streaming software - we're democratizing access to technology for underserved communities. Churches, disaster relief, military chaplains, international missions - anywhere reliable internet isn't available but communication is critical."

**Call to Action:**
> "We're raising $500K to complete development and launch our beta program. With 50 churches already interested in testing, we're looking for investors who understand both the technology opportunity and the social impact."

## Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions
**Q: "How does P2P handle network failures?"**
A: "libp2p includes automatic peer discovery and connection recovery. If the broadcaster goes down, viewers get notified immediately. We're also building peer relay capabilities so viewers can help distribute the stream."

**Q: "What about video quality and latency?"**
A: "Local network latency is typically under 10ms vs 500ms+ for internet streaming. Quality adapts automatically based on network conditions, but local WiFi can easily handle HD video."

**Q: "How do you prevent unauthorized access?"**
A: "Discovery keys act as passwords. Only devices with the correct key can find and join streams. All P2P connections are encrypted via libp2p."

### Business Questions
**Q: "Why won't big tech companies just copy this?"**
A: "They could, but it doesn't fit their cloud-first business models. Our offline-first approach is fundamentally different and serves markets they ignore."

**Q: "How do you compete with free solutions like Facebook Live?"**
A: "Facebook requires internet and has no privacy guarantees. We serve communities that can't or won't use big tech platforms."

**Q: "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"**
A: "Church conferences, word-of-mouth referrals, and partnerships with church supply companies. Churches trust recommendations from other churches."

### Market Questions
**Q: "Is the church market big enough?"**
A: "Churches are just the starting point. Emergency services, corporate training, educational institutions - any scenario where you need reliable local streaming."

**Q: "What about international expansion?"**
A: "Huge opportunity. Many developing countries have poor internet but growing smartphone adoption. We're already getting inquiries from missionaries."
