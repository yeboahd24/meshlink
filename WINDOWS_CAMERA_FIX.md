# 🚨 CRITICAL: You're Still in WSL2!

## 🔍 Problem Identified

You ran `.\meshlink-broadcaster-windows.exe` but you're **still inside WSL2**. The Windows .exe file can run in WSL2, but it **cannot access Windows cameras** because:

1. WSL2's FFmpeg doesn't support DirectShow (`Unknown input format: 'dshow'`)
2. WSL2 cannot access Windows camera hardware directly
3. Camera permissions don't work across the WSL2 boundary

## ✅ SOLUTION: Run in ACTUAL Windows

### Step 1: Exit WSL2
```bash
exit
```

### Step 2: Open Windows Command Prompt
- Press `Win + R`
- Type `cmd` 
- Press Enter

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\your\meshlink\project
```

### Step 4: Run the Windows Executable
```cmd
.\meshlink-broadcaster-windows.exe
```

## 🎥 What You Should See in Real Windows

## 🔧 Quick Test in Windows CMD

Once in Windows Command Prompt, test camera access:

```cmd
# This should list your cameras (will fail in WSL2)
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

You should see output like:
```
[dshow @ ...] DirectShow video devices (some may be both video and audio devices)
[dshow @ ...] "Integrated Camera"
[dshow @ ...] "USB Camera"
```

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- **WSL2**: Can run Windows .exe but NO camera access
- **Windows**: Full camera access with DirectShow support

Your streaming was working - it was just using a test pattern instead of your real camera!
